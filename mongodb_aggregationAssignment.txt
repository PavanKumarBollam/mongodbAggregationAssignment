1. use db.zipcodes.find() to filter results to only the results where city is ATLANTA and state is GA.
Sol: db.zipcodes.find({$and: [{city: "ATLANTA"}, {state: "GA"}]}).pretty()

2. use db.zipcodes.aggregate with $match to do the same as above.
Sol: db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$match: {city: "ATLANTA", state: "GA"}}]).pretty()

3. use $group to count the number of zip codes in Atlanta.
Sol: db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$match: {city: "ATLANTA" }}, {$group: {_id: {city: "$city"}, count: {$sum: 1}}}])

4. use $group to find the total population in Atlanta.
Sol: db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$match: {city: "ATLANTA" }}, {$group: {_id: {city: "$city"}, count: {$sum: "$pop"}}}])


Populations By State:

1. use aggregate to calculate the total population for each state.
Sol: db.zipcodes.aggregate({$group: {_id: "$state", population: {$sum: 1}}})

2. sort the results by population, highest first
Sol: db.zipcodes.aggregate({$group: {_id: "$state", population: {$sum: 1}}}, {$sort: {population: -1}})

3. limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 states in population?
Sol: db.zipcodes.aggregate({$group: {_id: "$state", population: {$sum: 1}}}, {$sort: {population: -1}}, {$limit: 3})


Populations by City:

1. use aggregate to calculate the total population for each city (you have to use city/state combination). 
You can use a combination for the _id of the $group: { city: '$city', state: '$state' }
Sol: db.zipcodes.aggregate({$group: {_id: {state: "$state", city: "$city"}, population: {$sum: 1}}})

2. sort the results by population, highest first
sol: db.zipcodes.aggregate({$group: {_id: "$city", population: {$sum: 1}}}, {$sort: {population: -1}})

3. limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 cities in population?
Sol: db.zipcodes.aggregate({$group: {_id: "$city", population: {$sum: 1}}}, {$sort: {population: -1}}, {$limit: 3})

4. What are the top 3 cities in population in Texas?
Sol:  db.zipcodes.aggregate ({$group:{_id:{state:'TX', city: '$city'}, population: {$sum: '$pop'}}},
{$sort: {population: -1}},{$limit:3})



Bonus:

1. Write a query to get the average city population for each state.
Sol: db.zipcodes.aggregate({$group: {_id: "$state", average: {$avg: "$pop"}}})

2. What are the top 3 states in terms of average city population?
Sol: db.zipcodes.aggregate({$group: {_id: "$state", average: {$avg: "$pop"}}}, {$limit: 3})
